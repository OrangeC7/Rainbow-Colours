# Rainbow-Colours-Resource-Pack
This is a 1.8.9 Minecraft resource pack that makes all coloured blocks shift colours
Each block changes colour every 2 seconds, but there is interpolation so the colour changing should not be disturbing for those not sensitive to quickly changing colours
On that note: EPILEPSY WARNING to anyone using this pack, please do not use this pack if you are sensitive to quickly changing colours.

To download, click the green "Clone or download" button and select "Download ZIP". Don't choose "Open in Dekstop" unless you know what you're doing.

If you need help installing resource packs on your computer, look up a tutorial for your operating system.
